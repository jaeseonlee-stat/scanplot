Description: The package 'scanplot' harnesses Kulldorff's (1997) scan statistics to efficiently detect spatial and temporal patterns in spatio-temporal datasets, with automatic distribution selection based on zero case prevalence between a Zero-inflated Poisson and Poisson distribution. The package includes a specialized plotting function for visualizing spatial clusters identified by the scan statistics across various temporal domains. This comprehensive toolkit offers users a streamlined solution for robust analyses and clear visualizations of spatio-temporal patterns in their data.
